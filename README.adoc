This project contains the following:
- A simple LineSegmentDetector class for detecting line segments for a given set of points.
- A RESTfull service that finds the longest line segment (or more of them if they are of the same length) for the given set of points.
- Unit tests for the LineSegmentDetector class
- System test for the service
